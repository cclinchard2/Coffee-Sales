# Coffee-Sales
This project examines different impact on coffee revenue. 

Tableau was used for visualizations, and the analyses (stepwise regression and multiple linear regression) were done in both R and Python (replicated).  

PDFs from R and Python are available to show the code, and the CoffeeSales_report.pdf provides the overview.
